## Description
This project is a fully functioning Tech Quiz application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The application allows users to take a tech quiz of ten random questions and view their final score. The primary goal of this project was to integrate Cypress testing for both component and end-to-end tests to ensure the application's reliability and robustness.
